# Copy as markdown quote

> A browser extension that copies the current selection as markdown quote, with link to the source.

## About

When research stuff online, I usually want to quick grab a text on a website and paste it directly in my Second brain (Notion/Obsidian) as a quote to the original site, without much thinking. The idea of this extension is to allow to do this, with a simple "Right click" -> "Copy as markdown quote".

This extension was tested in Chrome and Firefox browsers. It might work with other Chrome derivatives like Brave, but was not tested.
